On October 25th and 26th, 2025, Yoshihiko Matsumoto (D3) exhibited his research on link mechanisms at Science Agora 2025 (Telecom Center Building), where many people came to experience it. It was a great success. It was a wonderful time to share surprise and excitement.

The research results of Matsumoto, which were the basis of this exhibition, are now available in the [Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jamdsm/18/6/18_2024jamdsm0075/_article).
