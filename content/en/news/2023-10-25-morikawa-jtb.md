Collaborative research results by Kentaro Morikawa with Prof. Niimi, Prof. Morita, Prof. Sakura (National Institute for Basic Biology), Prof. Goto (Shizuoka University), and Prof. Maeno (National Institute of Genetics) have been published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
For organ shape in morphogenesis, we can estimate where and how much growth occurred from just two images: before and after growth!
