Collaborative research results by Yoshihiko Matsumoto and Prof. Yamasaki (Waseda University) have been published in the Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing.
We proposed a new method for designing link leg mechanisms using a genetic algorithm without predefining shapes, topologies, or trajectories, and demonstrated appropriate performance even in real environments.
