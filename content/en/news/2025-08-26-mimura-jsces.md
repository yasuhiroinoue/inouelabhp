Tomohiro Mimura's research paper has been accepted for publication in Transactions of the Japan Society for Computational Engineering and Science.

This study evaluated 13 distinct bending-energy discretization methods for morphogenetic simulations using cell-center models on anisotropic meshes. The research revealed that the Hamann model demonstrates superior accuracy for quantitative predictions, while the computationally efficient JÃ¼licher model suffices for capturing qualitative morphological trends.
