Joint research results with Prof. Ito (Chiba Univ) and others have been published in PNAS.

We discovered that at high actin concentrations, the activity of myosin molecular motors spontaneously organizes actin filaments into unidirectionally rotating ring structures (Actin Chiral Rings), and clarified its mechanism.
These findings uncover a principle of actin self-assembly driven by myosin and provide a framework for understanding how cytoskeletal chirality is established.
