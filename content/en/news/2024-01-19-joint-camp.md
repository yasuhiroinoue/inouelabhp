A joint research camp for the three Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A) 'Architect-Bio', 'Diorama Behavioral Dynamics', and 'Data Description Science' will be held at the University of Toyama. This time, mathematical researchers gathered from the three areas will tackle the experimental challenges of each area.
