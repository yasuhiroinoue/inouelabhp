Yoshihiko Matsumoto (D3) will present an exhibition at Science Agora 2025.

**Title**: Let's Move Link Mechanisms! ～Are you familiar with them?～

**Date**: October 25 (Sat) - 26 (Sun), 2025

**Location**: Tokyo Telecom Center Building 4F, Booth 405

**Program Overview**:
Are you familiar with "link mechanisms (or linkage)"? A link mechanism is a simple mechanism consisting of rigid bodies connected by pins or sliders. These mechanisms serve as important elements in various mechanisms because they can convert simple motion into complex motion. This program will demonstrate the wonderful motion and practical applications of link mechanisms using actual machines and simulations. Additionally, we want to discuss new applications of link mechanisms with participants.
