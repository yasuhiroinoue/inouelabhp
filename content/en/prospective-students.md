## About Research Themes
Our laboratory aims to create a new field of mathematical science rooted in life phenomena, "Life and Mathematical Sciences." We apply this innovative science to the design, production, and control of real-world systems, creating new systems for better living. Life and Mathematical Sciences can also be utilized in the study of natural and artificial phenomena, providing new perspectives for understanding the world. By understanding the fundamental principles of existing systems from the perspective of life mathematics, we promote their improvement and the development of entirely new designs and applications. The potential of systems created by applying life and mathematical sciences is limitless. We are pioneering the future at the forefront of this promising new field.

PI Inoue has been involved in a wide range of research, including biological morphogenesis, self-organization, emergence of collective coordination, linkage mechanisms, rheology of complex fluids, composite materials, soft matter, molecular dynamics, and network theory. While specializing in mechanics and statistical physics, he respects the interests and passions of each student, building specific research themes through collaborative discussions.

Our laboratory welcomes individuals who can deeply reflect on their research motivations and act proactively. While an active attitude and initiative are crucial for tackling original themes, we fully support this challenge. Here, you will find an environment where you can shape your ideas and advance your unique research.
