Creation of new mathematical sciences rooted in life phenomena and their engineering applications.

### Understanding Things As They Are
What does it mean to understand the laws of this world? When we extract a part of interest from the whole world, how can we say what it is the same as, what it contains, and how? In our laboratory, from this perspective, we constantly think about how to express nature as it is using mathematical and physical models, what we discard in the process, and what we can understand as a result. We are building new mathematical sciences that represent the world and developing them for engineering applications.
